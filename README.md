# Ed Kerry

I am currently a software engineer at Fuse Universal, working with a monolithic Ruby on Rails application. In addition to providing ongoing improvements for web users, through a Marionette and Backbone frontend, I work closely with mobile developers to provide API support for iOS and Android applications. Previously I have worked with a mix of existing Rails applications and green-field React JS microservices. At Notonthehighstreet.com I worked primarily on the consumer-facing aspects of the website, from initial landing pages through to making a purchase.

I enjoy being challenged by and learning from supportive, collaborative teammates in a friendly, creative and adventurous organisation.

#### Development

My initial training was with Ruby, using Rails as the web framework. I have also been able to develop skills with modern JavaScript, using ES6 with Babel as a transpiler, and Webpack to bundle code for production. Recently I have worked on two React applications, using Redux for state management.

I am familiar with API development, currently using GrapeAPI, and have experience with Amazon's SQS/SNS messaging systems.  

#### Testing

I start each feature by talking through requirements and success criteria with Quality Assurance and Product Owners. When developing I always follow BDD and TDD. I use tools including Cucumber, Capybara, Jest, Nightwatch, Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha and Enzyme.

#### Source control

Conscientious in making regular, clear commits and well-document pull requests. I am proficient with Git and Github. I enjoy the process of code review, finding it an excellent way of considering problems from another viewpoint and sharing knowledge.

#### Continuous Integration

Fast, safe development depends on quick feedback, best achieved by running the test suite on each push. I have used Jenkins, Circle and Travis for CI/CD. I want my code to help the end user as soon as possible, and to be improved from there!

#### Clear, clean code written the right way

My training at Makers Academy has stood me in good stead to follow best practice. I am more interested in developing tested, maintainable and valuable systems than writing complex, 'smart' and obscure code.  

#### Work flow

I am a strong advocate for pair programming. It offers mutually beneficial mentoring to both junior and senior developers, ensures code quality and helps share domain knowledge throughout the team.

Understanding the problem to be solved, and how to measure success, is very important to me. I aim to keep the end user in mind at all times, and seek to establish clear metrics in order to continuously improve their experience.

I enjoy the cadence of agile development, with regular ceremonies including standups, refinement and retros adding unity and cohesion to the team.

## Previous career experience

Previously a project manager and fundraiser, in 2015 I embraced a long-term desire to become a web developer. In my past roles I have helped over 600 vulnerable people learn life-saving skills, raised over Â£750,000 to transform the lives of people with learning disabilities, and delivered IT Security reports to cabinet ministers. These were not all the same job.

#### Detail-oriented Problem Solving

I greatly enjoy exploring potential solutions to problems, discovering the simplest and most effective methods. New problems are not daunting, but an opportunity to learn and achieve more!

- I am a logical, calm thinker. When multiple interesting options are available I am able to assess their suitability as the best tool for the job.
- I am persistent when facing adversity. Charitable and governmental project planning naturally involves limited resources, set-backs and uncertainty. I have found this mind-set very applicable to code.
- When facing a new problem, my first step is to research. In the past this has involved reading research papers or running focus groups. This has translated well to API documentation and StackOverflow.
- Solving a problem, especially if I am able to help someone else on the way, can be even more satisfying than everything working right first time! I am a regular volunteer coach at CodeBar, helping other people take their first steps into this exciting world.

#### Project planning

With over five years experience of project management, I am able to keep in mind the many small tasks that amount to a final product. Projects have included innovative first-aid training, launching a cafe run by and for adults with learning disabilities, and penetration-testing of websites.

- At the British Red Cross I led on the research and development of a PRINCE2 project. This project was nominated for a national Excellence award, and used as a model of best practice throughout the organisation.
- Working for a New Zealand government department, I co-ordinated a major Waterfall-driven ICT security project, and multiple smaller agile IT projects. These projects involved multiple stakeholders, including other government departments, the cabinet office and external contractors. I took part in regular Scrums with security consultants.
- The majority of these projects ran to deadlines and budget. However, I have often drafted escalation papers to explain deviations from expectations, and developed pivot-plans when necessary to keep things on track.
